# Simple Contract and Frontend Application

This project consists of a simple smart contract with 2-3 functions developed on the localhost. The frontend application allows users to interact with the contract by showing the values of those functions.

## Contract Functions

The smart contract deployed on the AVAX blockchain includes the following functions:

1. **`getBalance`**: This function retrieves the current balance of the user's Metamask account.

2. **`deposit`**: This function allows users to deposit  tokens into their  Metamask account.

3. **`withdraw`**: This function enables users to withdraw tokens from their Metamask account.

## Frontend Application

The frontend application is a web page that allows users to interact with the smart contract functions through a user-friendly interface. It provides the following features:

1. **Connect**: Users can click the "Connect" button to establish a connection with Metamask wallet on localhost.

2. **Balance**: The current balance of the user's account will be displayed dynamically on the webpage using the "getBalance" function.

3. **Deposit**: Users can enter the amount they want to deposit into their account and click the "Deposit" button to execute the "deposit" function on the smart contract.

4. **Withdraw**: Users can enter the amount they want to withdraw from their account and click the "Withdraw" button to execute the "withdraw" function on the smart contract.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install web3@latest jquery
   ```

5. Deploy the "contract.sol" file on the localhost network to obtain the contract address.

6. Update the "app.js" file with the contract address and other necessary details (e.g., contract ABI, account address).

7. Open the "index.html" file in your web browser.

8. Click the "Connect" button to establish a connection with the Meatmask Wallet.

9. The application will display the current balance, and you can interact with the "Deposit" and "Withdraw" functions accordingly.
